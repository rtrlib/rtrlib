/**
 * @defgroup mod_lpfst_pfx_h Longest prefix first search tree
 * @ingroup mod_pfx_h
 * @brief An implementation of a \ref mod_pfx_h "pfx_table" data structure
 * using longest prefix first trees (lpfst) for storing @ref pfx_record "pfx_records".
 * @details This implementation uses two separate lpfs-trees, one for IPv4
 * validation records and one for IPv6 records.\n
 * See \ref mod_pfx_h "pfx_table" for a list of supported operations of
 * this data structure.\n
 * For general details about the data structure see: <a
 * href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2007.01.023">Wuu et al. "A
 * longest prefix first search tree for IP lookup", Computer Networks,
 * 51(12), pp. 3354-3367, 2007</a>.

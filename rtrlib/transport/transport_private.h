/**
 * @defgroup mod_transport_h Transport sockets
 * @brief The RTR transport sockets implement the communication channel
 * (e.g., SSH, TCP, TCP-AO) between an RTR server and client.
 * @details Before using the transport socket, a tr_socket must be
 * initialized based on a protocol-dependent init function (e.g.,
 * rtr_tr_tcp_init()).\n
 * The tr_* functions call the corresponding function pointers, which are
 * passed in the tr_socket struct, and forward the remaining arguments.

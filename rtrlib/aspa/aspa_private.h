/**
 * @defgroup mod_aspa_h ASPA validation table
 *
 * @brief The @p aspa_table is an abstract data structure to organize the validated Autonomous System Provider
 * Authorization  data received from an RPKI-RTR cache server.
 *
 * # Updating an ASPA table
 * ASPA tables implement aggregated updating using an array of 'add record' and 'remove record' operations --
 * reducing iterations and memory allocations.  E.g., these operations can be derived from a RTR cache response.
 * Currently, two distinct update mechanisms are supported: **Swap-In** and **In-Place** updates. Use the macro
 * `ASPA_UPDATE_MECHANISM` in rtr/packets.c to configure which implementation is used during syncing.
 * The array of operations is effectively a diff to the table's previous state. This diff can be conveniently used to
 * notify callers about changes once the update is applied.
 *
 * ## Swap-In Update Mechanism
 * The ASPA table's **Swap-In** update mechanism avoids blocking callers who want to
 * verify an `AS_PATH` (and therefore need read access to the table) while an update is in progress and removes the
 * need for an *undo mechanism* in case the update to the ASPA table itself or some other action performed
 * inbetween fails.
 *
 * Performing an update using this mechanism involves these steps:
 * - **Compute Update**:
 *   Every time you want to update a given ASPA table, call `aspa_table_update_swap_in_compute`.
 *   This will create a new ASPA array, appending both existing records and new records. Everything needed to update
 *   the table is stored in an update structure.
 * - **Apply Update** or **Discard Update**:
 *   You either have to apply the update using `aspa_table_update_swap_in_apply` or discard it by calling
 *   `aspa_table_update_swap_in_discard`. This will either swap in the newly created ASPA array and notify
 *   clients about changes or discard and release data that's now unused.
 *
 * The implementation guarantess no changes are made to the ASPA table between
 * calling `aspa_table_update_swap_in_compute` and `aspa_table_update_swap_in_apply`
 * or `aspa_table_update_swap_in_discard`.
 *
 * ## In-Place Update Mechanism
 * The ASPA table's **In-Place** update mechanism involves in-place modifications to the array of records
 * and an undo function that undoes changes made previously.
 *
 * Performing an update using this mechanism involves these steps:
 * - **Update**:
 *   Every time you want to update a given ASPA table, call `aspa_table_update_in_place`. This will modify the ASPA
 *   array. If the update fails, `failed_operation` will be set to the operation where the error occurring.
 * - **Undo Update**:
 *   You may, but do not need to, undo the update using `aspa_table_update_in_place_undo`. This will undo all
 *   operations up to `failed_operation` or all operations.
 * - **Clean Up**:
 *   After computing the update you should go through a cleanup step using `aspa_table_update_in_place_cleanup`.
 *   This will deallocate provider arrays and other data created during the update that's now unused.
 *
 * ## Special Cases
 * There're various cases that need to be handled appropriately by both implementations.
 *   1. **Add existing record**:
 *     The caller attempts to add a record that's already present in the table (`ASPA_DUPLICATE_RECORD`).
 *   2. **Duplicate adds**:
 *     The caller attempts to add two or more records with the same customer ASN (`ASPA_DUPLICATE_RECORD`).
 *   3. **Removal of unknown record**:
 *     The caller attempts to remove a record from the table that doesn't exist (`ASPA_RECORD_NOT_FOUND`).
 *   4. **Duplicate removal**:
 *     The caller attempts to remove a record twice or more (`ASPA_RECORD_NOT_FOUND`).
 *   5. **Complementary add/remove**:
 *     The caller attempts to first add a record and then wants to remove the same record. This is equivalent to a
 *     no-op. `ASPA_NOTIFY_NO_OPS` (`1` or `0`) determines if clients are notified about these no-ops.
 *
 * ## Implementation Details
 * Both update mechanism implementations tackle the beforementioned cases by first sorting the array of 'add' and
 * 'remove' operations by their customer ASN stably. That is, 'add' and 'remove' operations dealing with matching
 * customer ASNs will remain in the same order as they arrived. This makes checking for cases 2 - *Duplicate
 * Announcement* and 4 - *Duplicate Removal* easy as possible duplicates are neighbors in the operations array.
 * Ordering the operations also enables skipping annihilating operations as described in case 5 - *Complementary
 * Announcement/Withdrawal*.
 * Both implementations are comprised of a loop iterating over operations and a nested loop that handles
 * records from the existing ASPA array with an ASN smaller than the current operation's ASN.
 * - If the record in the existing array and the current 'add' operation have a matching customer ASN,
 *   that's case 1 - *Announcement of Existing Record*.
 * - If the record in the existing array and the current 'remove' operation do not have a matching customer ASN,
 *   that's case 3 - *Removal of Unknown Record*.
